## How to Run

### Option 1: Using Node.js Server (Recommended)

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Or for development with auto-restart:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open your browser** and go to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```

4. **Add devices** by clicking the "Add Device" button on the dashboard

### Option 2: Direct File Opening

1. **Open `index.html`** directly in your browser
2. **Note**: Some features may be limited due to browser security restrictions

### Option 3: Using http-server (Alternative)

1. **Install http-server** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   npm install -g http-server
   ```

2. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   http-server -p 8000
   ```

3. **Open your browser** and go to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```

## Adding Devices

1. **Open the dashboard** (`index.html`)
2. **Click "Add Device"** button
3. **Follow the 5-step wizard**:
   - Step 1: Select device category
   - Step 2: Choose specific device type
   - Step 3: Configure device settings
   - Step 4: Set up Wi-Fi connection
   - Step 5: Review and add device

## Device Data Storage

Devices are stored in two locations:
- **Primary**: Browser's localStorage (for immediate access)
- **Backup**: `devices.json` file (for persistence and portability)

## Device Control Features

### Smart Bulbs & LED Strips
- Brightness control (0-100%)
- Color selection
- Power on/off

### Smart Locks
- Lock/unlock control
- Status monitoring

### Smart Thermostats & AC
- Temperature control
- Mode selection (Auto, Heat, Cool, Fan)
- Power control

### Security Cameras
- Recording quality selection
- Motion detection toggle
- Power control

### Smart Switches & Plugs
- Power on/off control

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome (recommended)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

## Troubleshooting

### Devices not loading?
- Check if `devices.json` exists and is valid JSON
- Clear browser cache and localStorage
- Restart the server

### Can't add devices?
- Make sure you're running the Node.js server (`npm start`)
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure all form fields are filled

### Server won't start?
- Check if port 8000 is already in use
- Try a different port by modifying `server.js`
- Ensure Node.js is installed
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies

## Development

### Adding New Device Types

1. **Update `deviceConfig`** in `add-device.html`
2. **Add device controls** in `getDeviceSpecificSettings()`
3. **Update device rendering** in `index.html`

### Modifying Device Controls

1. **Edit `getDeviceControlsHTML()`** in `index.html`
2. **Update event handlers** in `handleDeviceInteraction()`
3. **Test with different device types**
